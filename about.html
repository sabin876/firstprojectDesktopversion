  Mechi Multiple Campus (Nepali: मेची बहुमुखी क्याम्पस) is a constituent campus of Tribhuvan University in Bhadrapur municipality of Jhapa district. Founded in 1964, it is the only constituent campus of Tribhuvan University in the district. As of September 2014, there were 109 academic and 54 administrative staffs employed at the college.Since June 2016, the college administration has been headed by Kamal Guragain, who is often referred to as “campus chief”.

To begin with, the college offered an Intermediate of Arts (IA) program in humanities, which was soon followed by undergraduate programs. At present, the college runs undergraduate and postgraduate programs. The intermediate programs were fully scrapped in 2010, following Tribhuvan University’s decision to phase out Proficiency Certificate Level (PCL) programs from its colleges. This termination of PCL programs brought about a sharp decline in the number of students at the college.
